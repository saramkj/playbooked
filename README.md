# Playbooked

This app helps retail investors build discipline by forcing a pre-trade process before they can create a paper trade.

## What it does (MVP)
- Watchlist with tagged tickers
- Events (earnings/macro/news) created from watchlist items
- 1:1 Playbook per event, created from a template
- Process Gate hard-block (must pass 5 gates before a paper trade can be planned)
- Paper trade lifecycle (planned → open → closed/cancelled) with manual outcomes
- Weekly dashboard: win rate, avg P/L, and Process score

## Compliance note
Educational tool for process discipline; not investment advice; paper trading only.
